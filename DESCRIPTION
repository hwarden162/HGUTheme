Description: Functions to aid creating plots and images in R that are consistent
    with the colour theme as set out in the MRC HGU PowerPoint template. This 
    includes functions to access the HEX codes of the different colours, generate
    colour palettes from interpolations of these colours and automatically colour
    plots made by the `ggplot2` package.
