An *unofficial* package to help create plots that align with the colour themes of the the MRC Human Genetics Unit and other units at the Institute of Genetics and Cancer, Edinburgh. There are functions to return the colours used in each respective theme, return palettes that interpolate between the colours in each respective theme and layers that can be added to `ggplot2` plots to automatically scale colour and fill aesthetics.

**These palettes were created to align with the colour schemes of the respective institutions which themselves were not designed for use on plots. Therefore, please be thoughtful with your use of these colours and how they may effect colourblind people in interpretting the plots. More information on making your scientific plots colourblind friendly can be found in the [Colour Blind Friendly Plotting](https://hwarden162.github.io/HGUTheme/articles/ColourBlind.html) section.**
