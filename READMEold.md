# HGUTheme

Unofficial ggplot2 themes using the colour palette of the MRC HGU logo.

This package allows the user quickly change the colours of `ggplot2` plots such that they fit in with the colour theme set out in the MRC HGU powerpoint. For users comfortable with `ggplot2` there are functions to quickly return the HEX codes for each of the colours in the HGU and MRC colour themes. For users not so familiar with `ggplot2`, there are a variety of functions that act as wrappers for the styling functions that will automatically assign the correct colour values.

**These palettes were created to align with the colour schemes of the MRC and HGU palettes. They were not designed for use on plots and so please consider the effect of your palette decisions for colourblind people when using.**
