There are many different forms of colour blindness and in many situations it is impossible to make your plots completely suitable for everyone. However, there are many simple things that can be done to drastically increase the accessibility of your plots for people who suffer from colour blindness. Increasing the accessibility of your work makes life easier for everyone, making your plots more readable even to people who do not suffer from colour blindness.
